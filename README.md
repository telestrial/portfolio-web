# Web Portfolio

This [portfolio](johnwilliams.codes) represents a cumulative overview of the [self-guided bootcamp](https://github.com/telestrial/Self-Guided-BootCamp) work. It is written solely in HTML, CSS, and Javascript without any framework, and draws on design concepts present in portfolios by [Alex Calia](https://alexcalia.com/), [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/), [Sharon-Yi](https://sharon-yi.com/), and many others! At the time this was made, design principles were not part of the objectives of the bootcamp and, therefore, a completely novel design was not a priority. Instead, the web development behind the site is the focus.
